#### What I Do
I like building reliable backend and full-stack systems, from data-heavy ETL pipelines to Spring Boot microservices and Python tooling.  
Right now I’m finishing my master’s at Columbia and will spend Summer 2025 as an SDE intern at AWS.

**Tech I use regularly**  
Java 17, Python 3, Spring Boot 3, REST/gRPC, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, AWS, GCP, Docker/K8s, GitLab CI

#### Projects (selected)
* **PharmaId – Medication-List Service**  
  Spring Boot REST API on GCP (Cloud SQL) with JWT-secured roles, Swagger docs, and >90 % Jacoco test coverage.

* **XQL – XML → SQL Compiler**  
  Python tokenizer, recursive-descent parser, and SQL emitter that convert XML-encoded queries to PostgreSQL/MySQL.  
  Includes a Docker image that runs the unit-test suite in CI.
